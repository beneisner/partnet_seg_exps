### Code Repo

* The *data* folder contains the data. 
* The *exp* folder contains the code, under which you will find two experiment folders and two helper utils folders:
  1. *ins_seg_detecion* for PartNet Sec 5.3 Baseline Method;
  2. *ins_seg_sgpn* for SGPN Baseline;
  3. *utils* for utility functions;
  4. *tf_ops* for some customized Tensorflow layers (you may need to dive into each folder and run *tf_xxx_compile.sh* to compile the layer for your system)
* The *stats* folder contains some meta-data for the PartNet dataset that will be used by the code.
